<h2>Conformal mapping</h2>
<p>
	In mathematics, a conformal map is a function that preserves angles locally. In the most common case, the function has a domain and an image in the complex plane.

More formally, let U {\displaystyle U} U and V {\displaystyle V} V be subsets of C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} \mathbb {C} ^{n}. A function f : U → V {\displaystyle f:U\to V} {\displaystyle f:U\to V} is called conformal (or angle-preserving) at a point u 0 ∈ U {\displaystyle u_{0}\in U} {\displaystyle u_{0}\in U} if it preserves angles between directed curves through u 0 {\displaystyle u_{0}} u_{0}, as well as preserving orientation (i.e. mapping a tangent basis to a basis of the same orientation). Conformal maps preserve both angles and the shapes of infinitesimally small figures, but not necessarily their size or curvature.

The conformal property may be described in terms of the Jacobian derivative matrix of a coordinate transformation. If the Jacobian matrix of the transformation is everywhere a scalar times a rotation matrix, then the transformation is conformal.

Conformal maps can be defined between domains in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, and more generally on a Riemannian or semi-Riemannian manifold.
